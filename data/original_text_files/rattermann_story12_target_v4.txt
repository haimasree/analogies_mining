One day Jenny, a little girl from her neighbor's yard, was playing with her dog in the yard.
Eventually, the neighbor became quite upset with her and suggested that she keep her dog in the yard when she's playing with it.
After a few days, Jenny disguised herself at the playground in order to avoid having to do her chores in the house.
But after some time had passed, she decided to play with her dog at home because her neighbor had told her to do so every day.
It wasn't long before her mother nabbed her, and the little girl wished she hadn't listened to the neighbor.
