A girl named Cindy found some records she was curious about at a record store.
"These records look really bad," Cindy thought to herself.
"I think I'll buy them so I can see if my hunch is right."
But, the records were too expensive for her.
After thinking it over, she saw there was no way she could afford them.
Needless to say, she became somewhat disappointed.
