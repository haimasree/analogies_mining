A group of bats fly through an area.
Bats make sounds by using their mouths or noses to make sounds.
As the sound waves travel away from the bat, they are absorbed by the earth.
Sound waves hit objects as they travel through the air.
In order for the sound waves to reach the bat, they need to bounce off the objects.
As the sound waves reflect off of the objects, the bat hears them echoing back to him.
The bat is able to determine where the objects are because it is able to hear the sound echoes from where they are located.
As the bat hits the objects, it does not cause any injury to itself.
