There was a little girl named Jenny who loved to play with her dog in her neighbor's yard.
It didn't take long for the neighbor to become frustrated and tell her that she should always play with her dog in her own yard.
Jenny was found to have snuck out of the house without doing her chores a few days later and hid on the playground.
After a while, she went home to play with her dog because she thought her neighbor said she should do so every day because she thought it was good for her.
Right away her mother caught her, and the little girl wished that she had not listened to her neighbor.
