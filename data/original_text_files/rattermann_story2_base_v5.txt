As the manager of a razor making company, Mr. Newton managed to avoid being fired.
An inventor at his company perfected a metal that stayed sharper than any other razor during the next year.
But it wasn't long after that that Mr. Newton thought it would be fun to try out this new razor and he accidentally cut his neck extremely badly.
As a result of this incident, the inventor recommended a safety feature that would ensure that people won't suffer from injuries.
Mr. Newton, after witnessing the incident, felt the safety feature would be absolutely important.
His reaction to that incident was so alarming that he immediately started to produce a safety razor as soon as possible.
It's a good thing he didn't catch an infection in his neck so everything went well.
