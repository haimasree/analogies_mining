Several years ago, there was a tiny country called Zerdia that was making the world's smartest computer.
It wasn't long ago that Zerdia was attacked by its warlike neighbor, Gagrach.
However, the missiles that were launched were ill-aimed and the attack failed.
It was only a matter of time before the Zerdian government realized that Gagrach required Zerdian computers, so it offered to sell some of its computers to the country.
As a result Gagrach was extremely pleased with the offer.
In return, Zerdia promised that it would never attack it again.
