The job entrusted to Ms. Boyce was to install heat lamps sold by the Smith Tan Company.
One of the suppliers for the company, in 1980, developed a filament that was able to generate much more intense heat than any previous filament.
Ms. Boyce was seriously burned when she used one of the new heat lamps on her own a short period of time later.
Due to this accident, the manufacturer of the new lamp recommended a warning label to prevent people from injuring themselves if they attempt to use this lamp.
It was after this incident that Ms. Boyce viewed the labels as necessary.
As a result of the accident she was so frightened that she immediately had labels printed.
