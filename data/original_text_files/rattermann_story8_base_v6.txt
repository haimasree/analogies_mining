The other day, a dog named Leonard was having a steak stuck in his jaws as he trotted along a dock.
It was not his intention to drop it, but he dropped it inadvertently during his trot, so it disappeared into the water.
This resulted in him being deprived of his dinner as a consequence.
A second dog with a steak was then spotted by Leonard.
He tried to take it from the table as he had lost his own steak earlier in the night.
Unfortunately, the dog next to him was much bigger than he was.
The scuffle ended with Leonard losing a tooth in the end.
