Two small countries, Bolon and Salam, were adjacent to a large, warlike country called Mayonia.
Bolon decided to make the best of the situation by taking over Salam.
Salam started looking for aid from other strong countries but soon Bolon succeeded in taking it over.
Then victorious Bolon proposed to make a treaty with its warlike neighbor Mayonia.
Bolon proposed to give Mayonia control over Salam in exchange for a guarantee that Bolon would remain independent.
Mayonia responded by overrunning both Bolon and Salam.
Bolon was so busy maintaining control of Salam, it could do nothing to stop Mayonia.
Therupon, Mayonia installed puppet governments in both Bolon and Salam, and took over the newspapers and radio stations.
