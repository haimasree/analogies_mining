Charlie was walking through a hotel carrying an expensive pocket watch in his hand, when he spotted the man.
It was accidentally dropped on the floor as he walked, and it broke when it hit the floor.
As a result, he had no watch with him in the evening.
After seeing the other man with an expensive watch, Charlie decided to buy that watch.
As he had broken his own watch earlier in the day, he reached out to take the watch from the man.
Unfortunately, that man did not want to be taken.
