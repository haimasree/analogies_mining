Karla, a large hawk whose home was atop a tall oak tree, lived at the top of the tree.
One afternoon, she spotted a hunter who had a bow and some crude arrows that had no feathers at all on the ground.
It seemed like he was aiming at the hawk, but he missed.
After knowing the hunter wanted her feathers, Karla glided down to the hunter and offered to give him a few of them.
The hunter was so grateful that he pledged to never shoot at a hawk again if he saw one again.
However, instead of shooting at a hawk, he shot a deer.
