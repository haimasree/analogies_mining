Leonard, a dog holding a steak in his teeth, took a stroll along the dock, toting the steak along with him.
During the trot, he dropped the sack accidentally and it sank into the lake as he trotted.
As a consequence, he wasn't able to eat dinner.
Then Leonard saw that another dog was eating a steak.
The reason he tried to take his own steak was because he lost his own.
The other dog, unfortunately, was quite a bit bigger than him.
Leonard ended up losing a tooth during the scuffle and had to take it out.
