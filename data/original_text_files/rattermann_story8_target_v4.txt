A pocket watch had been found in the pocket of an expensive pocket watch that Charlie was carrying through a hotel.
His shattered glass fell on the ground when he accidentally dropped it while walking.
He was without a watch for the rest of the day.
After seeing this, Charlie saw an expensive watch on the wrist of another man.
In the end, he reached out to take his own watch after he had broken his own watch.
The man, however, was actually a policeman.
