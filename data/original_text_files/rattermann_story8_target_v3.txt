The story goes that Charlie was walking through a hotel with a pocket watch in his hand while he walked through.
As he walked, he accidently dropped the jar, and it broke on the ground.
Due to this, he did not have any watch to wear.
Charlie then noticed another man who was wearing a luxury watch.
It was because of his broken watch that he reached out to take it.
However, he was a police officer, so he was unable to take it.
