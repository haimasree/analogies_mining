It was not long ago that a hawk called Karla lived at the top of an oak tree.
On one afternoon, she saw a hunter on the ground with a bow and some crude arrows which had no feathers, while he was in the middle of the forest.
At that moment, he took aim at the hawk but missed it.
She realized the hunter was after her feathers so Karla swooped down to the hunter and offered to give him some feathers.
A hunter, who was so overcome with gratitude that he never shot at a hawk again, promised he would never do so again.
Therefore, he went out and bought a deer instead.
