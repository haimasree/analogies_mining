There was a large oak tree on top of which lived an old hawk named Karla.
She witnessed a hunter with a bow and some crude arrows that were devoid of feathers one afternoon when she was walking in the forest.
The hunter took aim and fired at the hawk, but the shot was not successful.
The hunter could see that Karla wanted her feathers, so in her gliding, she offered to give him a few of her feathers.
As a result of his great effort, the hunter vowed to never shoot at a hawk ever again.
Eventually, the hunter went on to kill a deer instead.
