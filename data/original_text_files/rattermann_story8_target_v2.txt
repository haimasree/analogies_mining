An expensive pocket watch was in Charlie's hand as he walked through the hallways of a local hotel.
During his walk, he dropped it by accident and it shattered on the floor.
Because of this, he was left without a watch.
Then, Charlie saw another man with a very expensive watch.
Since he had broken his own watch, he reached out to grab it so he could fix it.
The only problem was that the man was a policeman.
