Karla, an old hawk, lived atop a large oak tree, where she lived alone.
Suddenly, she noticed a hunter on the ground with a crude bow and an arrow with no feathers sitting on the ground.
After taking aim and shooting at the hawk, the hunter inadvertently missed the bird.
Karena knew that the hunter wanted her feathers, so she glided down to the hunter's side and offered to give him a few feathers.
As a result of this incident, the hunter promised himself that he would never again go after hawks.
As a result, he went and shot deer instead.
