I saw a dog named Leonard trotting along a dock carrying a steak in his mouth.
When he trotted along, however, he dropped the object inadvertently and it disappeared into the lake.
As a result, he was unable to eat his dinner.
Leonard saw another dog with a steak next to him.
Having lost his own steak, he tried to take it back with him.
It was unfortunate that the other dog was much bigger than he was.
As a result of the scuffle, Leonard lost a tooth.
