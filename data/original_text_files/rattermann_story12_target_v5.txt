When Jenny was a little girl, she loved to play with her dog on the lawn of her neighbor.
Eventually, the neighbor got so upset he told her that she should always play with her dog in her own yard.
Jenny snuck out of the house a few days later without doing anything with her chores and hid in the playground for a few minutes.
In any case, she eventually went home to play with her dog because she thought her neighbor told her she should every day.
In just a few seconds, her mother caught her and the little girl realized she shouldn't have listened to her neighbor.
