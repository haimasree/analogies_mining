In the evenings, Morris, a simpleminded prisoner who enjoyed playing the harmonica, enjoyed playing the harmonica with others.
He finally grew weary of this and demanded from his cellmate that he stop talking.
In his opinion, he should always play during the daytime, the cellmate said.
During the night of the next day, Morris escaped from prison and hid in a boxcar.
However, Morris then remembered that his cellmate said he should play harmonica every single day, so he decided to start playing.
The police came almost immediately and took Morris into custody.
The simpleminded, poor Morris wished he had never noticed his fellow prisoner at all.
While he was back in his cell, he continued to cover the walls with obscenities.
