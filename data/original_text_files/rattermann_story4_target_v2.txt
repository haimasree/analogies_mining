One day there was a small country called Zerdia that learned how to make the world's smartest computer.
There was a time when Zerdia was attacked by its warlike neighbor, Gagrach.
However, the missiles were poorly aimed and the attack was a failure.
As soon as the Zerdian government realized that Gagrach wanted Zerdian computers, it offered to sell some of its computers to the country.
The Gagrach government accepted the offer with great enthusiasm.
The government promised never to attack Zerdia again.
