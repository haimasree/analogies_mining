Mrs. Boyce was in charge of installing the heat lamps sold by the Smith Tan Company.
It was in the year 1980 that a supplier for the company perfected a filament that could produce more intense heat than any other filament that had ever been created before.
Ms. Boyce was seriously burned when she used one of these new heat lamps herself later on in the day.
Because of this accident, the supplier recommended a warning label that would provide people with the safety they require when using the new lamp.
It was then that Ms. Boyce felt that the labels were absolutely necessary.
She was so scared by the accident that she had the labels printed immediately after it happened.
