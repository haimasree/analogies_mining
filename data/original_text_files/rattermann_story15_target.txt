Linda, the director of a girl scout camp, was thinking about the camp on the beach while all the girls were hiking in the hills nearby.
While she was standing there the girl scouts returned and they all started pestering her with questions about what was for dinner, could they go swimming, and so on.
"Why do you pester me when I am racking my brain to figure out what we're going to do?" Linda screamed as she ran off the beach and down the road.
"Show a little appreciation!" The scouts followed her, still yelling.
A short time later, a tidal wave hit the beach and washed away all the sleeping bags.
