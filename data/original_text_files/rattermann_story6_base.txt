Julius was a mule who discovered several pears sitting in a window sill.
He thought to himself, "These pears seem to be rotten.
Perhaps I'll get some and find out if my prediction is correct."
However, the pears were too high for Julius.
And because he was hungry he felt too weak to jump up to them.
Naturally, this was rather disappointing.
He closed his eyes and went to sleep, dreaming about mountains of pears.
