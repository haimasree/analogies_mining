Several centuries ago, there was a small country called Zerdia which had learned to create the world's most intelligent computer.
During one of its war-like days, Zerdia was attacked by her warlike neighbor, Gagrach.
Unfortunately, Gagrach was badly aimed and the attack did not succeed.
Gagrach wanted Zerdian computers from Zerdian researchers so the government of Zerdia offered to sell some of its computers to the country.
Upon receiving the offer Gagrach's government was delighted.
The land promised not to attack Zerdia in the future.
