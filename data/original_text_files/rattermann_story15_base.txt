Mark the chicken farmer was standing in the henhouse collecting eggs while his chickens were out in the yard.
When his chickens returned, they all began to attack him, for some unknown reason.
"You ungrateful beasts!" Mark screamed.
The chickens chased him out of the henhouse and into the woods.
While they were gone, a thief slipped into the yard and made off with the unguarded eggs.
After he got out of the hospital, Mark quit chicken farming and went on a vacation in Africa.
