Throughout the night, Morris loved playing the harmonica on his harmonica, an instrument he loved to play as a prisoner.
As a result, his cellmate finally got tired of hearing him and told him to shut up.
According to the cellmate, he should always carry on playing during the day.
After escaping from prison and hiding in a boxcar the next night, Morris escaped from prison.
However, Morris remembered his cellmate had told him to play harmonica every day, and so he began playing harmonica.
He was immediately taken into custody by the police.
In Morris' view, he was a simple-minded, poor boy who wished he hadn't paid any attention to his cellmate.
Having returned to his cell, he spent the rest of the day writing obscenities on the walls.
