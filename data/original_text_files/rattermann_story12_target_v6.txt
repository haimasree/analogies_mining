Jenny, a little girl who loved playing with her dog in her neighbor's yard, was always running around with it.
She eventually got fed up with her neighbor and asked if she could please always play with her dog in her own yard.
A few days later, Jenny snuck out of the house without doing what she had been asked to do and hid at the playground.
However, after awhile she went home to play with her dog, as she remembered her neighbor telling her that she should do it every day.
The little girl was instantly caught by her mother and she wished that she hadn't listened to her neighbor and was able to avoid it.
