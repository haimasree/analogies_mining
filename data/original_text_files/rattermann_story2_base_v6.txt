A razor company owned by Mr. Newton was a company that manufactured razors.
It was one year ago when an inventor in his company perfected a metal that would stay sharper longer than any previous razor.
A safety feature that would prevent people from injuring themselves was recommended by the inventor in response to this incident.
A safety feature that would prevent people from injuring themselves was recommended by the inventor in response to this incident.
Newton believed that the safety feature was absolutely necessary as a result of what had occurred.
As a result of the incident, he became so alarmed that he began to produce the safety razor right away.
He did not develop an infection in his neck, so everything turned out well in the end.
