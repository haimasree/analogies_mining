Two sixth-grade boys, Lincoln and Moreland were walking to school together when they met Chad.
Chad was a mean high school boy who was known to rob younger kids.
Moreland was scared but he decided to make the best of the situation by overpowering Lincoln.
Immediately, Lincoln started running to find a policeman but Moreland ran after Lincoln and eventually succeeded in catching him.
When Chad arrived Moreland offered to let him rob Lincoln in exchange for being left alone himself.
But Chad robbed both of them.
Moreland was so busy holding Lincoln down, he could do nothing to prevent it.
