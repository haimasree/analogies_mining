The simple-minded Morris was an incarcerated man who loved to play the harmonica after dark.
It was finally his cellmate who, getting tired of him talking all the time, demanded that he shut up.
This fellow argued that he should play during the daytime, not at night.
The following night, Morris escaped prison, snuck into a boxcar and hid from authorities.
As Morris began to play harmonica, he remembered that his cellmate had told him that he should play harmonica every day, so he started playing.
Immediately after playing, Morris was caught by the police.
In his poor, simple-minded way, Morris wished he had not paid attention to his cellmate.
When he was in his cell, he devoted himself to covering the walls with obscenities.
