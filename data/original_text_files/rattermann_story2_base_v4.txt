A razor manufacturer called Newton, which was managed by Mr. Newton, started the business in 1993.
There was an inventor in his company who discovered a metal that would remain sharp for a longer period of time than any other material.
But not long afterwards, Mr. Newton was using one of these new razors and he discovered that he had cut himself quite severely on the neck.
The inventor then recommended adding a safety feature to the device that would prevent people from getting injured in the future due to this incident.
As a result of this incident Mr. Newton deemed the safety feature essential to protect people from themselves.
It was so alarming to him that he went right to the store and bought the safety razor immediately after the incident.
Fortunately, the infection to his neck did not spread and everything was fine.
