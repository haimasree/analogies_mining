A little girl named Jenny loved to play with her dog in the yard of her neighbor.
At one point, her neighbor got fed up with her and told her she should always play with her dog in her own yard.
It wasn't long after that Jenny sneaked out of the house without doing the chores and went to the playground to hide.
But after awhile, she went back to her house to play with her dog because she thought her neighbor had told her that she should do it every day.
Immediately after hearing the neighbor, the little girl's mother caught her, and she wished she had not heeded her neighbor's advice.
