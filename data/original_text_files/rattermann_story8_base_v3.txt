As Leonard trotted along a dock, he held a steak in his teeth while he trotted along.
The problem is that he dropped it inadvertently as he trotted and the ball went into the water.
So, he was left without his dinner as a result.
Leonard then noticed another dog with a steak on his head.
The reason he attempted to take the steak was because he had lost his own.
Sadly, the other dog was much bigger than him, so he was unable to catch up with him.
The scuffle resulted in Leonard losing a tooth in the process.
