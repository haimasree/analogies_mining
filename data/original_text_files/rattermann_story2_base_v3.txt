As the manager of a razor manufacturing company, Mr. Newton brought to life his vision for this company.
An inventor within his company invented a metal one year that would keep its sharpness longer than any previous razor had done.
Then, a short time later, Mr. Newton was using one of these new razors and he cut his neck seriously as he was using one.
The inventor, in his attempt to prevent others from injuring themselves as a result of this incident, suggested a safety feature to prevent this from happening.
Given what happened in the previous instance, Mr. Newton considered the safety feature as a matter of utmost importance.
It had alarmed him so much that he began immediately to make the safety razor after the incident.
He had been so alarmed by the incident that he started producing the safety razor from the very first moment.
His neck was lucky not to get infected, so everything turned out just fine.
