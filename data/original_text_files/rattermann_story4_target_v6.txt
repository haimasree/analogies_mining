In the past, there was a small country that was called Zerdia, which became the creator of the world's smartest computer.
The nation of Zerdia was recently attacked by its warlike neighbor, Gagrach.
Unfortunately, the missiles weren't aimed well enough to cause damage and the attack failed.
It was discovered the Zerdian government wanted Zerdian computers but Gagrach did not have any so they offered to sell some to the country.
The government of Gagrach was very pleased when it learned about this.
Hence, they promised they would never attack Zerdia again.
