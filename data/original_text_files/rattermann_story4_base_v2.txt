An old hawk named Karla lived at the top of a tall oak tree.
On one afternoon, she found a hunter on the ground with a bow and some crude arrows that did not have feathers.
The hunter took aim and shot at the hawk but was unsuccessful.
It was obvious to Karla that the hunter wanted her feathers, so she glided down to him and offered him a few of hers.
It was such a relief for the hunter that he pledged never to shoot at a hawk in the future.
Rather, he went off and shot a deer instead.
