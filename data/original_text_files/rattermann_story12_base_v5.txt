As a simple-minded prisoner that loved to play the harmonica at night, Morris enjoyed the company of his fellow prisoners.
It wasn't long before his cellmate had enough and began demanding that he stop talking.
His cellmate firmly steadfastly insisted that he must play during the day.
The following night, Morris escaped from prison and went into hiding in a boxcar.

As soon as Morris started playing, the cops stepped in.
A poor, simple-minded Morris regretted that he had been paying any attention at all to his cellmate.
He returned to his cell and began spray painting the walls of the cell with obscenities.
