The dog, Leonard, was trotting along a dock holding a piece of steak in his mouth as he crossed it.
In the end, as he trotted, he inadvertently dropped it, and it disappeared into the lake.
Therefore, he was not able to eat the dinner that he had planned.
Leonard was shocked to see another dog with a steak in his mouth.
In order to get his steak back, he tried to steal it since he had lost his own steak.
Unfortunately, the other dog was much larger than he was, so he had to give up.
It was during this scuffle that Leonard lost a tooth.
