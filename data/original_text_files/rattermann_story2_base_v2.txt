Having managed a company which produced razors, Mr. Newton was the manager of the company.
The following year, one of the inventors in his company perfected a metal that would stay sharper than any previous razor.
But not too long after that, Mr. Newton was using one of these new razors and he sliced his neck rather severely.
In response to this incident, the inventor suggested that a safety feature be added to protect people from sustaining injuries.
Considering what had happened Mr. Newton felt the safety feature was an essential feature.
The incident had so alarmed him that he began the production of the safety razor as soon as possible.
In a happy turn of events, his neck did not get infected, and so everything turned out fine.
