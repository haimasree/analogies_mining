The prisoner Morris was a simple-minded prisoner who loved to play the harmonica in the evenings.
In the end, his cellmate got tired of this and demanded that he shut up.
The cellmate insisted that he should always play during the daytime.
Morris escaped from prison the next night and hid in a boxcar for the night.
Morris then remembered that his cellmate told him that he should play harmonica every day, so he started playing.
Almost immediately, Morris was nabbed by the police.
A poor, simple-minded Morris wished that he had not paid attention to his cellmate as much as he did.
While he was still in his cell, he devoted himself to writing obscenities on the walls.
