Boris and Ivan thought well of one anothers' skill in business and resolved to open up a store together.
As ill luck would have it, Ivan was quite absent-minded and he threw out a large amount of cash.
This annoyed Boris who therefore demanded that Ivan have nothing to do with the monetary matters of their new store.
Later, however, Ivan redeemed himself by selling his fancy new stereo set to replace the lost cash.
