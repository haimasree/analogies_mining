In her role as the installation manager for the Smith Tan Company, Mrs. Boyce installed heat lamps sold by the company.
There was a filament perfected by a supplier for this company in 1980 that was capable of producing more intense heat than any other filament at that time.
Later on when Ms. Boyce was trying to use one of these new heat lamps herself, she was seriously burned as a result.
After this accident, the supplier recommended a label that would warn people against injuring themselves with the new lamp in the event of a future accident.
Because of this, Mrs. Boyce considered the labels an absolute necessity.
Her frightened reaction to the accident led her to have the labels printed immediately after the incident.
