During her time at the Smith Tan Company, Ms. Boyce was assigned the task of installing heat lamps.
One of the company's suppliers perfected a filament in 1980 that could produce more intense heat than any other filament to date.
It was only later on when Ms. Boyce was using one of these new heat lamps for herself that she was seriously burned.
Upon learning of this accident, a warning label was recommended by the supplier to prevent the public from getting injured by the new lamp.
Due to this incident, Ms. Boyce believed that warning labels were a necessity.
It was so frightful for her that she immediately ordered the labels to be printed after the accident.
