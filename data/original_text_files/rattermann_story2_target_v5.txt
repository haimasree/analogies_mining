During the daytime, Ms. Boyce had responsibility for installing the heat lamps sold by the Smith Tan Company.
A supplier for the company in 1980 perfected a filament that produced more intense heat than any filament that had ever been produced before.
In the end, however, when Ms. Boyce broke one of these new heat lamps while using it herself, she was seriously burned.
Because of this accident, the supplier recommended that the new lamp be accompanied with a warning label that would prevent people from harming themselves with the power supply.
After this accident Ms. Boyce thought that the labels were very important.
She was so terrified by the accident that she immediately ordered labels to be printed.
