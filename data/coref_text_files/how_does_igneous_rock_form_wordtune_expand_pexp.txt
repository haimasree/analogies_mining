The magma contained within volcanoes is called magma.
Magma is very hot and can be seen as a gas.
Magma rises from the bottom of the volcano to the surface.
When the magma reaches the surface, Magma cools down.
Once the magma starts cooling, Magma starts to harden.
Sometimes the magma is released from the volcano in the form of lava.
While the magma or lava is cooling, Magma solidifies into a rock called a lava rock
