Aluminum cans and other products are placed into recycling bins so that Aluminum cans and other products can be recycled.
The municipality of your town or a private company will be responsible for collecting and transporting the aluminum to a recycling facility.
It is at the central recycling facility that the aluminum is sorted and cleaned.
the aluminum is melted down in order to remove coatings and inks from the aluminum.
When aluminum is melted, aluminum is formed into large formations called ingots.
Upon arriving at another facility, the ingots are rolled out so that the ingots are easier to manipulate.
It is now possible to manufacture new aluminum products from the ingots.
