It's bats flying.
Bats make sounds with Bats mouths or noses.
A bat's sound travels away from A bat's.
A sound wave hits an object.
A sound wave bounces off the objects back to the bat.
Echoing sound waves are heard by the bat.
Bats know where objects are by where the echo came from.
By hitting objects, the bat does not hurt A bat's.
