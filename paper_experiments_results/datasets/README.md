* proPara_paragraphs.json -- contains the texts in the paragraphs that we used (390 paragraphs from proPara training set)

* CognitivePsychology_Keane.csv -- here we used the General / The surgeon analogous stories.

* CognitivePsychology_Rattermann.csv -- here we used the "source story" column as the base, and "True Analogy Story" column as the target.
As mentioned in the Paper (Section 4.2) we ended up with 14 pairs of stories (instead of the 19 in the dataset)
as we filtered out stories with dialogue or at most two mappings.
