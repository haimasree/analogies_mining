**precision_k_automatic_paraphrases.csv** file contains the data of the top of table6 (automatic paraphrases).
It is generated by running **run_robustness_to_paraphrases_exp.py** (run experiment function with AUTOMATIC_PARAPHRASES). <br/>

As we mentioned in the paper (Section 4.3) the number of the same verbs in the sentences of the paraphrases paragraphs is 
20% (80% distinct). It can be printed by set the **run_identical_verbs_stats** flag to True 
when running the code in **run_robustness_to_paraphrases_exp.py**. <br/>
  
**precision_k_responses_to_the_same_prompt.csv** file contains the data of the bottom of table6 (responses to the same prompt).
It is generated by running **run_robustness_to_paraphrases_exp.py**  (run experiment function with RESPONSES_TO_THE_SAME_PROMPT). <br/>
  
Running **run_robustness_to_paraphrases_exp** will plot the two 
images in figure10 (precision@K for k in 1-100 for automatic paraphrases and responses to the same prompt).
