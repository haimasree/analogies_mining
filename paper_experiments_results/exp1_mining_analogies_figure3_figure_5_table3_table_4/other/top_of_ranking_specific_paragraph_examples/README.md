We include here the top of the ranking for specific paragraph examples. 
(by running **run_propara_all_pairs_exp.py** on specific examples)
From a brief inspection, results seem to support our conclusions -- FMQ and FMV find variety of analogies at the top, 
for a specific paragraph, while SBERT find only self (and sometimes some close analogies at the top of the ranking).
