* precision_k_automatic_paraphrases.csv file contains the data of the top of table6 (automatic paraphrases).
This file is generated by running the experiment in run_syntactic_modifications_exp.py.
As we mentioned in the paper (Section 4.3) the number of the same verbs in the sentences of the paraphrases paragraphs is 
20% (80% distinct). It can be printed by set the run_identical_verbs_stats flag to True 
when running the code in run_syntactic_modifications_exp.py.
