Ray problem,
"Suppose you are a doctor with a patient who has a malignant tumour in his stomach. It is impossible to operate on the patient; but unless the tumour is destroyed the patient will die. There is a kind of ray that can be used to destroy the tumour. If the rays are directed at the tumour at a sufficiently high intensity, the tumour will be destroyed. Unfortunately, at this intensity the healthy tissue that the rays pass through on the way to the tumour will also be destroyed. At lower intensities the rays are harmless to the healthy tissue but they will not affect the tumour either. What type of procedure might be used to destroy the tumour with the rays, and at the same time avoid destroying the healthy tissue?",
Experiment 1,
The General (far analog),The Surgeon (near analog)
"A general was trying to destroy a fortress which was situated at the centre of a country with roads leading to it, by using his amry. He needed to use his army as a complete group in order to destroy the fortress. However, he could not march his army down a road to the fortress because the roads were mined to explode when large groups of men passed over them.

After considerable thought, he knew just what to do. He divided his army up into small groups of men, and by sending these groups, simultaneously, from a number of different directions, they converged on the fortress, making up a sufficiently powerful army to destroy it.","A surgeon was trying to destroy a cancer which was situated in the central region of a patient's brain, by using a type of ray. He needed to use these rays at a high intensity in order to destroy the cancerous tissue. However, at such an intensity the healthy brain tissue will also be destroyed.

After considerable thought, he knew just what to do. He divided the rays up into batches of low-intensity rays, and then by sending them, simultaneously from a number of different directions, they converged on the cancer, making up a sufficiently high intensity to destroy it."
Experiment 2,
General-Ray,General-Laser
"A general was trying to destroy an intercontinental ballistic missile, using a type of ray, which would be entering the atmosphere at great speeds. He needed to use a high-intensity ray in order to destroy the incoming missile. However, such high-intensity rays were inaccurate because they would heat up the air through which they passed, thus distorting the beam.

After considerable thought, he knew what to do. He divided the high-intensity rays into a number of low-intensity rays and, by sending these low-intensity rays, simultaneously, from a number of different directions, they converged on a missile making up a sufficiently powerful beam to destroy it.","A general was trying to destroy an intercontinental ballistic missile, using a type of laser beam, which would be entering the atmosphere at great speeds. He needed to use a high-powered laser beam in order to destroy the incoming missile. However, such high-powered laser beams were inaccurate because they would heat up the air through which they passed, thus distorting the beam.

After considerable thought, he knew what to do. He divided the high-powered laser beams into a number of low-powered laser beams and, by sending these low-powered laser beams, simultaneously, from a number of different directions, they converged on a missile making up a sufficiently powerful beam to destroy it."
