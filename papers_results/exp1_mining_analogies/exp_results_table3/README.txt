* The aggregated results of analogy type in top-100 of the ranking for each method (Table 3 in the paper)
are in ProParaPairs_FMQ_sim_07_pair_1_100, ProParaPairs_FMV_sim_05_pair_1_100 and ProParaPairs_SBERT_pair_1_100 csv files.

* ProParaPairs_100_random_pairs: contains the 100 pairs we sampled in random from all of 75K~ pairs

* The other files are different part of the ranked list for the different methods
(e.g, FMQ_sim_07_pair_18964_19003 are the pairs in the 25% of the ranked list for FMQ),
as we can see in these parts only not-analogy is found for all methods.
