1	the plasma membrane encloses the cell.
2	the plasma membrane controls the movement of materials into and out of the cell.
3	the nucleus controls these cellular activities.
4	these cellular activities require energy.
5	the mitochondria extract energy from food molecules to provide the energy needs of the cell.
6	animal cells must also synthesize a variety of these proteins.
7	ribosomes produce these proteins.
8	the cell may use these proteins or move these proteins out of the cell for use in other cells.
9	to move organic molecules, the cell contains this system of membranes.
10	this system of membranes is called the endoplasmic reticulum .
